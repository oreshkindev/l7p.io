          <a href="mailto:dpo@xwardpay.io">dpo@xwardpay.io</a>.
        </p>

        <h4>How Long Will We Keep Your Personal Data?</h4>

        <p>
          We will keep your personal data for such a period as is required for us to provide services to you, or such a longer period as we may be required to process the data to
          ensure our compliance with all relevant laws and regulatory obligations to which we are subject.
        </p>

        <h4>How and Where Do We Store Your Personal Data?</h4>

        <p>
          Personal data is processed both manually and electronically and may be held in a number of different places in line with the operations of a typical business. The
          locations your personal data could be stored include, but are not limited to:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Our databases and CRM;</li>
          <li>Emails on computers;</li>
          <li>Mobile phones and tablets;</li>
          <li>Contact address books;</li>
          <li>Business cards;</li>
          <li>Notebooks;</li>
          <li>Electronic documents on our file servers;</li>
          <li>Paper files in our offices;</li>
          <li>Cloud back-up and storage.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The security of your personal data is important to us, and to protect your data we use and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your
          personal data and to prevent the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of or access to personal data transmitted, stored or
          otherwise processed. We have a framework of policies, procedures and training to cover information and cyber security, confidentiality and data protection.
        </p>

        <h4>Sharing and Transfer of Personal Data</h4>

        <p>
          We will only disclose personal data to third parties as is necessary to provide our services and/or to comply with your instructions. We may share your personal data with
          our affiliates and subsidiaries. We do not give or sell your personal information to third parties.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition, we may be legally required to share certain personal data, which might include yours, if we are involved in legal proceedings or complying with legal
          obligations, a court order, or the instructions of a government authority.
        </p>

        <p>
          If any of your personal data is required by a third-party, we will take steps to ensure that your personal data is handled safely, securely, and in accordance with your
          rights, our obligations, and the third-party’s obligations under the law.
        </p>

        <p>As some of our external third parties are based outside the EEA, the processing of your personal data may involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>

        <p>
          Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is
          implemented:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>the country to which we transfer your personal data has been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission;</li>
          <li>a specific contract approved by the European Commission which gives safeguards to the processing of personal data, the so called Standard Contractual Clauses.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Confidentiality</h4>

        <p>
          We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal information against loss, theft, and any form of unauthorized access. Only those who are
          authorized employees, agents, or representatives that require access to your personal information in order to fulfill their job requirements will have access to the
          information. Our obligations will become effective only when the information is received by us physically or by its internal systems, but not while it is in transmission
          out of or to our physical possession or internal systems; because data exchange over the internet or the telephone system or physical mail cannot be guaranteed to be
          perfectly secure, any personal information you submit to us or access electronically or over the telephone is done at your own risk, and we does not guarantee or warrant
          the security of information so transmitted to us. You should exercise caution to prevent any third parties, or parties fraudulently posing as us, from unlawfully
          intercepting your transmissions or causing you to disclose personal information.
        </p>

          personal information for fulfillment. Note that in case of such withdrawal of consent we may no longer be able to provide certain of our products or services which
